# Course3-GettingandCleaningData

#Summary: This project uses the data in the 'The UCI Machine Learning Repository' 
# This helps to understand and use the tidy data set that can be used for future analysis purposes
# Source data link - https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

# Please note that this file is pointed to my local directory. If you try to process the data with this file, then 
# you need to change the path to your local in the line no. 14

#This project does the following.
## runAnalysis.r - This script will perform the following 5 parts on the UCI HAR Dataset zip file
## Part 1 - Merge the training and test sets to create one data set.
## Part 2 - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
## Part 3 - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
## Part 4 - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
## Part 5 - From the result above, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable
## for each activity and each subject

## Additionally, CodeBook.MD file has more information on the variables, data, and transformations used in this project.

## Project files:
## run_analysis.R - Complete R script to analyze the data
## tidy.txt - Dataset extracted by running the run_analysis.R script
## CodeBook.md - the CodeBook referencing the variables in tidy.txt
## README.MD - This file that you are reading.


## Thank you! Happy Coding!
